# PortManagement

These are just scripts, written in Powershell for mostly Windows 10, that I use to block or control the flow of traffic, directed to, or originating from my computers. 

When there's a BIG vulnerability that comes out, I go down in comment sections and forums and find out what ports are affected on the host machines, and make a script to block out connections to my devices. 

One time it was 137-139 and 445, (https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/11/mass-router-hack-exposes-millions-of-devices-to-potent-nsa-exploit/?comments=1) next time, who knows what it'll be!
